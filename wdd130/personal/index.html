            Welcome to Simply Character! If you’re looking to make a simple Character for Dungeons and Dragons, 
            you’ve come to the right place. This website will give you a step-by-step process on how to make a 
            level one character, all you need is a character sheet and a pencil. These steps don’t have to be done 
            in any specific order, but this path can help later steps make more sense. If you change your mind on 
            anything, you can always backtrack steps. You can start from the beginning at step 1 or if you’ve already 
            started you can select the step you’re on or missed below. Offical content can be found in the rule books or at Dndbeyond.com.

        <img id="species" src="images/half-elf.jpg" alt="species">
        <p id="p1">
            Step 1 is picking your character’s species. A species or race is what a person is. Are they a magical elf, 
            a loud dwarf or are they an unoriginal human. This step sets up what you are and what you look like.
        </p>
        <p id="p2">
            Step 2 will be picking your character’s class. A class is a person’s skill, what they trained to become. Are they 
            a brave knight ready to fight evil, a sneaky thief just looking for his next gold coin, or a powerful wizard 
            looking for knowledge. This step sets up a lot of what your character can do and what they’re good at.
        </p>

        <img id="stats" src="images/stats.jpg" alt="stats">    
        <p id="p3">
            Step 3 will be setting up your character’s stats. Each character is different, some are stronger, some are quicker and 
            some are smarter. Your character’s stats will change how effectively your character can swing a sword, sneak around, 
            or recall information.
        </p>
        <p id="p4">
            Step 4 will have you pick a background and help you figure out your character’s personality. 
            Your character’s background is about where your character came from, what decisions lead your character to where or 
            who he is, what leads him to make new decisions.
        </p>

        <img id="equip" src="images/equipment.jpg" alt="equipment">
        <p id="p5">
            Step 5 will talk about your equipment and spells. Not all characters 
            fight with a sword or staff, choosing your equipment can get you some helpful stuff, but also some story behind your 
            character. Not all characters use magic but if they do, they will get to pick what spells they cast.
