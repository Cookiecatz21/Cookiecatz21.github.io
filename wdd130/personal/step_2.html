        Step 2: Class
    </h1>
        <p id="intro">
            Step 2 will be picking your character’s class. A class is a person’s skill, what they trained to become. 
            At level one you will pick a class for your character. Think of it like a major or an occupation. 
            Level one gives you some base features which include the following.<br><b>Hit Points,</b> this is how much 
            damage your character can take before fainting. Depending on your class you will have a certain amount 
            plus your constitution modifier (which will be talked about more in step 3).<br><b>Proficiencies</b> are given based 
            on the class you choose. These include armor, weapons, tools, saves, and skills.<br><b>Equipment</b> is also given; 
            step 5 will talk more about this.<br><b>Abilities,</b> which will be given to you as you level up, level one included.
