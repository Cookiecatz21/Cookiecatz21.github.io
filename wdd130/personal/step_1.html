        <p intro>
            Step 1 is picking your character’s species. A species or race is what a person is. Are they a magical elf, 
            a loud dwarf or are they an unoriginal human. This step sets up what you are and what you look like. Each 
            species has a list of characteristics to think about when you choose them. Those characteristics are as 
            follows:<br>An Ability increase, all species give a small raise to two stats (more on this in step 3).<br>Age, 
            all species have different lifespans and mature at different ages.<br>Alignment, more will be said on alignment 
            in step 4, but each species tend to learn to certain alignments.<br>Size, species have different heights and 
            weights, each species is also considered medium or small in size.<br>Speed refers to how far a species can walk 
            in 6 seconds or one turn.<br>Abilities are also given, which are important benefits that your character will be 
            able to do when necessary.<br>Languages are also given; these help you talk with other characters who don’t speak 
            the common language.<br>Lineages, some species come from different lineages or sub-species which give a few more abilities.

            Dwarves are a resilient and proud race known for their strong connection to stone and metal. They are typically 
            short and stocky, standing around 4 to 5 feet tall, but they are as heavy as humans due to their dense build. 
            Dwarves are renowned for their craftsmanship, especially in forging weapons and armor, and they have a deep sense of tradition and honor.

            Elves are an elegant and mystical race known for their grace, longevity, and connection to nature and magic. They are slender and tall, 
            typically standing between 5 and 6 feet, with pointed ears and an unearthly beauty. Elves are known for their long lifespans, often living 
            for hundreds of years, which gives them a unique perspective on the world.

            Humans are the most versatile and adaptable race. They are often seen as the "jack-of-all-trades" of the fantasy world. While they may 
            lack the specialized traits of other races, their adaptability and ambition make them a popular choice for players.
