        Step 1: Species
    </h1>
        <p id="intro">
            Step 1 is picking your character’s species. A species or race is what a person is. Are they a magical elf, 
            a loud dwarf or are they an unoriginal human. This step sets up what you are and what you look like. Each 
            species has a list of characteristics to think about when you choose them. Those characteristics are as 
            follows:<br><b>An Ability increase,</b> all species give a small raise to two stats (more on this in step 3).<br><b>Age,</b> 
            all species have different lifespans and mature at different ages.<br><b>Alignment,</b> more will be said on alignment 
            in step 4, but each species tend to learn to certain alignments.<br><b>Size,</b> species have different heights and 
            weights, each species is also considered medium or small in size.<br><b>Speed</b> refers to how far a species can walk 
            in 6 seconds or one turn.<br><b>Abilities</b> are also given, which are important benefits that your character will be 
            able to do when necessary.<br><b>Languages</b> are also given; these help you talk with other characters who don’t speak 
            the common language.<br><b>Lineages,</b> some species come from different lineages or sub-species which give a few more abilities.

            Dwarves are a resilient and proud race known for their strong connection to stone and metal. They are typically 
            short and stocky, standing around 4 to 5 feet tall, but they are as heavy as humans due to their dense build. 
            Dwarves are renowned for their craftsmanship, especially in forging weapons and armor, and they have a deep sense of tradition and honor.

        <p id="p2">
            Elves are an elegant and mystical race known for their grace, longevity, and connection to nature and magic. They are slender and tall, 
            typically standing between 5 and 6 feet, with pointed ears and an unearthly beauty. Elves are known for their long lifespans, often living 
            for hundreds of years, which gives them a unique perspective on the world.

        <p id="p3">
            Humans are the most versatile and adaptable race. They are often seen as the "jack-of-all-trades" of the fantasy world. While they may 
            lack the specialized traits of other races, their adaptability and ambition make them a popular choice for players.
