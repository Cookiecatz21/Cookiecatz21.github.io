      Step 5: Equipment & Spells
  </h1>
      <p id="intro">
        Each class and background both have a list of items to choose from for your starter
        Equipment. When choosing it's important to think of what your character can use and 
        what he would use. Each weapon has different benefits and disadvantages, be sure to 
        read your weapons triats. Depending on your class you will also get a number of spells
        read the spell casting ability in the class featuters section of your class to learn more
        about how many spells you know and how many you can cast.
