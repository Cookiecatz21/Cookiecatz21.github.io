      Step 3: Stats
  </h1>
      <p id="intro">
          Each Character has 6 Stats, these stats decide bonuses to rolls on skill checks and saving throws. 
          the simpilest way to choose stats is to take the numbers 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, and 8, and choose which 
          stat to put each number in. A stat will calculate the modifier, for 10 and 11 the modifieris 0 but 
          every two numbers going up increases the modifier by one and every two numbers going down adds a 
          negative one, which means 12 and 13 would be +1, 14 and 15 would be +2, and 8 and 9 would be -1.
          To calculate a skill or saving throw bonus simply add the modifier for the stat it uses and your 
          proficiency bonus if proficent. Below are the six stats and a little about them:
      </p>
  <main id="grid">
      <img id="str" src="images/str.png" alt="Strength">
      <p id="p1">
        the Strength stat represents a character's physical power and ability to exert force. A higher 
        Strength score means your character is stronger and more capable in physical tasks It's crucial 
        for characters who rely on brute strength, like fighters, barbarians, and paladins.
      </p>
      <img id="dex" src="images/dex.png" alt="Dexterity">
      <p id="p2">
        Dexterity represents a character's agility, reflexes, and balance. Dexterity is the cornerstone 
        of stealthy or nimble characters. It's vital for characters who rely on finesse, speed, or 
        ranged combat—like rogues, rangers, and monks.
      </p>
      <img id="con" src="images/cons.png" alt="Constitution">
      <p id="p3">
        Constitution represents a character's physical resilience, endurance, and overall health. 
        Constitution is universally important because everyone benefits from staying alive longer. 
        It's crucial for characters who need to withstand damage or survive tough conditions—such as 
        barbarians, clerics, and druids
      </p>
      <img id="int" src="images/int.png" alt="Intelligence ">
      <p id="p4">
        Intelligence represents a character's mental acuity, analytical ability, and depth of knowledge. 
        A high Intelligence score reflects a character's sharp mind and expertise in academic or magical 
        fields. It's particularly important for classes like wizards and artificers, which rely on Intelligence 
        for spellcasting.
      </p>
      <img id="wis" src="images/wis.png" alt="Wisdom">
      <p id="p5">
        Wisdom represents a character's intuition, perceptiveness, and connection to the world around them. 
        Characters with high Wisdom often excel at noticing details, understanding others, and connecting 
        with the natural or spiritual world. It plays a key role in many situations that require awareness or 
        spiritual insight. Wisdom is especially crucial for classes like clerics, druids, and rangers.
      </p>
      <img id="cha" src="images/cha.png" alt="Charisma">
      <p id="p6">
        Charisma represents a character's charm, confidence, and ability to influence others. High Charisma 
        reflects a magnetic and confident presence. It's a vital stat for characters who rely on persuasion, 
        social interactions, or sheer force of personality—such as bards, sorcerers, paladins, and warlocks.
